# jeden
Jeden computer language

Welcome to Jeden!
=================

Jeden, pronounced “yeah-den”, is a computer language and environment at the intersection of high-performance computing and formal mathematics. Programs written in Jeden and compiled in proof-mode are _guaranteed_ not to crash. Furthermore, properties of values and functions can be expressed and verified by the compiler, in which case the program is _proven_ to do what is expected.

In technical terms
------------------

In technical terms, Jeden has the following features:

  * homotopy type system, on top of a Martin-Löf type system
  * univalent universes
  * arrow notation
  * lazy semantics, strict execution
  * staged compilation to machine code

Project Status
==============

The project is still in its infancy. The boot-strapper for the language is being written in Haskell.
